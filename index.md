# CTF Write Ups by Trent Walraven

The prior CTFs I've worked on:

* [sp00kyCTF](/competitions/sp00kyCTF/)
* [SnyCon CTF (Fetch the Flag)](/competitions/SnykConCTF/)
* [ALLES!2021 CTF](/competitions/ALLES!2021/)

Other non Cyber Security Related Activities

* [Emergency Management Honors Seminar](https://spark.adobe.com/page/4C9XxCZ951Cca/) - An honors seminar I am taking this semester, about preparing and responding to emergencies focusing on mass-casualty incidents where the resources available are far lower than what is needed to adequately treat everyone. This link is an article for the mock tornado that we recently has the ooppurinuty to participate in to test the knowledge we have gained.
