# CYBE 231 - Cyber Security Tools

A primarily lab driven class that teaches the basics of the tools and offensive tactics of the Cyber Security field. This class is cross listed as CPRE 231, so at any point if you say that it is the same class. We started out the semester with passive and open source information gathering, with things like public records, and social media to find out useful information about a "target."
