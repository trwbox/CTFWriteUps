# CYBE230 Lab 3 - Accounts, Permissions, and Network Tools

This lab we continued talking about many of the basics of linux, with things like file permissions, user accounts. We then moved into basic networking tools like ping, dig, netstat, etc. Using these to learn about things like ICMP traffic, DNS records, open ports. At the end of the lab, we took a wiershark and tcpdump to capture traffic from a machine to a website.
