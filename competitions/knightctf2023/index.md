# knightctf (20 Janurary 2023)

## Description

This was a was the first CTF that [iasg](https://iasg.github.io) as club particpated in during the Spring 2023 semester. This was also the first CTF that I particpated in that I only had an M1 MacBook running MacOS in, which was an interesting self-inflicted challenge at times.

## Forensics

- [H3LLO IOS](forensics/H3LLOIOS/) - This challenge required finding a flag in an iOS update package.

## Reverse Engineering

- [Fan](reverse/Fan/) - Learning that python assembly does indeed exist, and learning how to turn that back into code.

## Crypto

- [Xorathrust](crypto/Xorathrust/) - A simple xor challenge that needs reversed to get the flag.
- [Vaulter](crypto/Vaulter/) - A custom made crypto that used interesting methods.
- [Encode Mania](crypto/EncodeMania/) - 12 time randomly encoded flag, not a fun thing if I wanted to try this by hand.

## Web

- [GET Me](web/GETMe/) - It lied, I couldn't just GET the flag...

## Misc

- [Dirt](misc/Dirt/) - All credit to MacOS unzip tool for listing directories as it unzipped.
