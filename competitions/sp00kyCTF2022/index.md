## OSINT

- [Seeking Someone](OSINT/SeekingSomeone/) - Got this image, but where was it taken?
- [They're on the move!!](OSINT/TheyreOnTheMove/) - Well, they moved, let's try again.
- [CampusLife1](OSINT/CampusLife1/) - Finding which spooky building this is for a Halloween CTF, what an on theme challenge
- [CampusLife2](OSINT/CampusLife2/) - Less spooky of a building, more spooky difficulty, so overall a wash on spookiness
