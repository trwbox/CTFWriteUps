# Jan 31 - Hello

## Description

Hi! I'm Sam! I'm in third grade, and that means I have to give everyone in my class a Valentine ðŸ™„ Instead of just getting a 25-pack of cards from the dollar store like everybody else, I want to give everyone something impressive, something special! I'm just a nine-year-old so I'll need your help!

If you're up to the task, enter the valentine from our Discord below! It's pinned in the #announcements channel.
