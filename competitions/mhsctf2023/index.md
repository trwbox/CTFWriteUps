# MHSCTF (31 Jan 2023 - 14 Feb 2023)

## Description

This is a Valentine's Day CTF put on by Mentor High School's CTF, I put this CTF out to the [IASG](https://iasg.github.io){:target="_blank"} community to participate in since it seemed like a potentially easier beginner CTF for newer students.

## Misc

- [Hello](misc/hello/) - A welcome challenge that was as difficult as joining a discord server.

## PWN

- [Balloons](pwn/balloons/) - A challenge that involved creating an exploit for a python2 program that used the `input()` function.

## WEB

- [Chocolates](web/chocolates/) - A challenge that takes you on a journey of cracking a flask session cookie.
