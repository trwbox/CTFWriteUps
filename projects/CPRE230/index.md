The first in the series of required Cyber Security Classes at Iowa State University. This class is an overall introduction into what it is like to be a Blue Team member. It has a student doing mostly lab based work of creating systems, and building out a network. In a couple of the labs we talked about common web vulnerabilities, showed examples of them, and hwo to mitigate them.
